3. Interest in IT appeared after I learned from friends about the QA profession. I auditioned for courses at EPAM, but because of A2 English I could not get into the courses. A year later, I entered the EPAM courses on GOLang, but during my studies I realized that the back-end was not mine and began to study JS on my own. At the time of application, I studied lectures from YouTube, went through the LearnJS, tried to make up  landing page. Also had experience working as a tester at Wargaming.net
Qualities that give in training:
* learnability - like of reading, incl. professional literature and a constant desire to develop
* analytical mind - ease in making decisions in non-standard situations
* sociability - I easily find the language with different personalities
* literacy - the ability to express thoughts in an accessible manner, both thesis and detailed
* adaptability - easily tolerate changes in working conditions and quick adaptation to new conditions

4. * JavaScript (HTML, CSS)
   * GOLang
   * Git (hub, laboratory)
   * VS Code

5.    ### JS

```js
function capital(capitals){
  return capitals.map(function(item) {
    if (item.country) {
      return `The capital of ${item.country} is ${item.capital}`
    } else {
      return `The capital of ${item.state} is ${item.capital}`
    }
  })  
}
```
